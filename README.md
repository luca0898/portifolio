# Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio was intentionally built as a **static site** to keep the stack lean and the delivery fast. Rather than starting from scratch, I chose **Astro** for its performance-first approach and **OpenAI Codex** to accelerate boilerplate and content creation. The result was a clean, production-ready site delivered in **a few hours**, proving that this decision was effective and pragmatic.

## Key Decisions
- **Static architecture:** no server-side complexity, faster builds, easier hosting.
- **Astro framework:** minimal JS by default and excellent performance for content-driven pages.
- **OpenAI Codex assistance:** sped up repetitive tasks and helped deliver the first version quickly.
- **Rapid delivery:** the entire portfolio was assembled in a few hours, validating the choice to keep the stack lightweight.

## Main Tools
- **Astro** (static site framework)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **TypeScript** (type-safe development)

## Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
